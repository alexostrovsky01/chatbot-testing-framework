        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "The step failed to address the entire user question. The user asked about two distinct topics: their computer and getting paid. The output only addresses the payment aspect, making the overall response incomplete and therefore incorrect for the given multi-intent input."

      "relevance": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The output is highly relevant to one part of the user's question (getting paid) but completely ignores the other part (computer information). Because the step is named \"full_rag_pipeline\", it is expected to handle the full scope of the query. By missing a key topic, its relevance is significantly diminished."
