        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The 'rewrite_query' step correctly identified the two distinct intents (computer setup and payment information) within the complex user question. It successfully deconstructed the original query into separate, well-formed, and actionable questions. It even proactively inferred a relevant third question about security, which is a common and important topic for a new employee."

        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The output is highly relevant to the overall chatbot goal. By breaking the compound query into discrete topics, it enables the subsequent routing step to function effectively. For example, 'How do I set up direct deposit...' can now be cleanly routed to the 'Billing' agent, while the computer-related questions can be routed to the 'General' agent. This decomposition is a critical prerequisite for accurate routing."

        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "The output structure is technically valid, but its content is flawed due to significant data duplication. The node from 'it_onboarding.txt' (id: ce070c66...) appears three times, and the node from 'payroll.txt' (id: 2e89ae...) appears twice. A retrieval step should return a unique set of relevant documents. This level of redundancy indicates a bug in how the results from the multiple input queries are aggregated and deduplicated, which will negatively impact downstream processing."

      "relevance": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The step successfully retrieved highly relevant nodes for two of the three input questions: the 'it_onboarding.txt' node for the computer setup question and the 'payroll.txt' node for the payment question. However, it failed on the third question about security measures, instead retrieving a non-relevant node from 'conduct.txt' about ethical standards. This demonstrates a partial failure in semantic understanding and retrieval for one of the key topics."

        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The 'rerank_nodes' step failed to perform its function correctly. It incorrectly dropped a highly relevant node from 'it_onboarding.txt' which directly addresses the 'my computer' part of the user's query. Additionally, it failed to deduplicate the input nodes, resulting in two identical 'payroll.txt' nodes in the output. The output scores are also extremely low and identical, which is highly suspect for a reranking operation and suggests a malfunction in the scoring logic."

      "relevance": {
        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "The output is only partially relevant to the user's multi-intent question. While it correctly identifies and retains the nodes related to 'how I get paid', it completely discards the equally relevant nodes concerning the 'computer' portion of the query. By providing an incomplete set of information, this step prevents the chatbot from formulating a comprehensive answer, thus failing to fully address the user's needs."

        "reasoning": "The 'synthesize_answer' step accurately and correctly summarized the information provided in its input nodes. The generated response is a well-formed, natural language summary of the text found in the 'payroll.txt' source document. From the perspective of this single step's function, it performed perfectly given the inputs it received."

      "relevance": {
        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "The original user question had two distinct topics: computer information and payroll information. The generated response only addresses the payroll topic. It completely ignores the user's question about their computer, making the answer only partially relevant to the user's overall query. The failure likely occurred in an upstream step (e.g., routing or retrieval) that failed to find information for the 'computer' part of the question, but the output of this step is ultimately incomplete for the end-user."
