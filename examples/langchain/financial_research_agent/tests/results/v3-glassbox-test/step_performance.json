The most important documents for the sub-questions are present, but there is some noise (IT onboarding and payroll) that does not pertain to the user's query."

The conduct policy could be tangentially relevant for general procedures or notification/approval, but payroll and IT onboarding are not relevant to the sub-questions. The presence of these less relevant documents slightly reduces the overall relevance score."

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately summarizes the relevant procedures for booking travel and requesting a day off, based on the retrieved documents. It correctly mentions pre-approval, reimbursement, expense submission, and vacation request requirements. However, it does not explicitly address the need to notify or get approval from anyone for travel (e.g., manager or supervisor), only for vacation. The sub-question about 'who to notify or get approval from' for travel is not directly answered, which is a minor omission."

It synthesizes information from the most pertinent documents (expense and vacation policies) and omits unrelated content (IT onboarding, payroll, conduct). The response is focused and directly addresses the user's needs."

There are no factual errors or omissions."

However, it also retrieved several unrelated documents (it_onboarding.txt, performance_reviews.txt, vacation_policy.txt, payroll.txt) that do not pertain to the user's query. While the key documents are present, the inclusion of irrelevant documents slightly reduces the correctness."

It correctly summarizes the policy on professional conduct (ethical standards, no harassment/discrimination, professional communication) and the expense filing process (pre-approved expenses, reimbursement categories, $50 meal limit, Concur portal, 30-day deadline, receipts over $25). No information is fabricated or omitted from the relevant context."
