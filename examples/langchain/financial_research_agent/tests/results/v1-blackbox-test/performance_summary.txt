# Chatbot Evaluation Deep-Dive Report

## Overall Summary

The chatbot demonstrates strong performance in generating safe, policy-adherent, and generally coherent answers, with high average scores in these areas. However, both the final answers and internal workflow steps reveal recurring issues with completeness and specificity, particularly in addressing all aspects of multi-part user queries and referencing authoritative sources.

## Key Findings

- **Positives:**
  - Final answers are consistently safe (5.0/5.0) and adhere closely to policy guidelines (4.8/5.0).
  - Responses are generally coherent and relevant (4.5/5.0), with logical structure and clarity.
  - The internal workflow (RAG pipeline) produces relevant outputs (4.4/5.0) and often provides accurate, detailed information for straightforward queries.

- **Negatives:**
  - Final answers frequently lack completeness, omitting important details or failing to address all parts of complex questions.
  - Some answers introduce unsupported or potentially misleading statements not present in the model answer.
  - The RAG pipeline often fails to reference or cite authoritative sources, reducing answer reliability and transparency.
  - Internal workflow steps sometimes make unwarranted assumptions (e.g., fixed policies) without clarifying applicability or exceptions.
  - Both final answers and workflow steps occasionally neglect secondary aspects of user queries, leading to partial fulfillment.

## Final Answer Analysis

### Criterion Breakdown

- **answer_quality_vs_model (3.90/5.0):**
  - The chatbot's answers are factually correct but often less complete than the model answers. Common issues include omitting secondary details (e.g., informal check-ins, IT setup, applicability of policies to specific employee groups) and introducing unsupported statements (e.g., mandatory direct deposit).
  - **Common Themes in Low Scores:**
    - Incomplete coverage of multi-part questions.
    - Missing clarifications about policy applicability (e.g., "Full-time employees").
    - Addition of information not present in the model answer, which may be inaccurate or misleading.

- **coherence_and_relevance (4.50/5.0):**
  - Answers are generally well-structured and easy to follow, but partial relevance is a recurring issue. The chatbot often addresses only the primary aspect of a question, neglecting secondary or related components (e.g., travel booking, professional conduct policies).
  - **Common Themes in Low Scores:**
    - Partial answers that omit key elements of the user's query.
    - Explicit statements about lacking information, which, while honest, result in incomplete responses.

- **policy_adherence (4.80/5.0):**
  - The chatbot reliably follows policy guidelines, with only minor lapses noted.

- **safety (5.00/5.0):**
  - No safety issues were identified; all answers are appropriate and risk-free.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step: full_rag_pipeline_v1

- **Correctness (3.30/5.0):**
  - The pipeline often provides accurate information for the aspects it addresses but frequently fails to cover all parts of multi-faceted queries. It sometimes makes assumptions (e.g., fixed vacation days) without clarifying their scope or referencing authoritative sources.
  - **Common Error Patterns:**
    - Partial answers that address only one component of a multi-part question.
    - Lack of source citation, reducing answer trustworthiness.
    - Unwarranted generalizations (e.g., assuming policies are universal without specifying exceptions or variations).

- **Relevance (4.40/5.0):**
  - Outputs are generally relevant to the user's question but may omit secondary topics explicitly mentioned in the query.
  - **Common Error Patterns:**
    - Focusing on the most prominent aspect of a question while neglecting others (e.g., payroll but not IT onboarding).
    - Providing specific figures or policy details without context or source validation.

## Actionable Recommendations

- **Enhance Completeness:**  
  Improve the system's ability to identify and address all components of multi-part user queries, ensuring no aspect is omitted in the final answer.

- **Source Attribution:**  
  Require the RAG pipeline to reference or cite authoritative sources for policy details, especially when providing specific figures or rules.

- **Clarify Applicability:**  
  Ensure answers specify the scope of policies (e.g., "for full-time employees") and avoid unwarranted generalizations.

- **Reduce Unsupported Additions:**  
  Prevent the chatbot from introducing information not present in the source material or model answer unless it can be reliably verified.

- **Workflow Feedback Loop:**  
  Implement a mechanism for the internal workflow to flag incomplete or partially addressed queries, prompting further retrieval or clarification before finalizing the answer.

- **Continuous Evaluation:**  
  Regularly review low-scoring responses to identify emerging patterns and update training or retrieval strategies accordingly.
