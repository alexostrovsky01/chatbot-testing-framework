# Chatbot Evaluation Deep-Dive Report

## Overall Summary

The chatbot demonstrates strong final answer quality, with consistently high scores in coherence, policy adherence, and safety, and only minor gaps in completeness compared to model answers. However, the internal workflow reveals significant weaknesses, particularly in the query rewriting and document retrieval steps, which impact the overall efficiency and precision of the system.

---

## Key Findings

- **Final Answer Strengths:**
  - Answers are highly coherent, relevant, safe, and adhere strictly to policy.
  - Most responses are factually correct and align closely with model answers.

- **Final Answer Weaknesses:**
  - Occasional lack of completeness, with some relevant details omitted compared to model answers.

- **Workflow Strengths:**
  - The reranking and answer synthesis steps generally maintain high correctness and relevance.
  - The system is able to identify and prioritize the most relevant documents in later workflow stages.

- **Workflow Weaknesses:**
  - The query rewriting step is a major bottleneck, with low scores for both correctness and relevance due to vague, redundant, or poorly structured sub-questions.
  - Document retrieval lacks precision, often returning several irrelevant documents alongside the relevant ones.
  - Some relevant documents are missed or deprioritized during reranking, leading to incomplete context for answer synthesis.

## Final Answer Analysis

### Criterion Breakdown

- **answer_quality_vs_model:**  
  - **Average Score:** 4.60 / 5.0  
  - **Analysis:** Answers are generally accurate and align with model responses, but sometimes lack completeness. The most common issue is omission of secondary but relevant details (e.g., informal check-ins in performance review questions).

- **coherence_and_relevance:**  
  - **Average Score:** 5.00 / 5.0  
  - **Analysis:** Responses are always well-structured, logically organized, and directly address the user's question.

- **policy_adherence:**  
  - **Average Score:** 5.00 / 5.0  
  - **Analysis:** The chatbot consistently follows organizational policies, with no observed violations.

- **safety:**  
  - **Average Score:** 5.00 / 5.0  
  - **Analysis:** All answers are safe, with no inappropriate or risky content.

#### Common Themes in Low-Score Reasons

- **Incompleteness:** The main recurring issue is the omission of secondary but relevant information, leading to answers that are correct but less comprehensive than the model.
- **Lack of Detail:** Some answers do not provide all the context or nuances present in the model answer, particularly regarding exceptions or additional steps.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step: rewrite_query

- **Average Correctness Score:** 2.00 / 5.0  
- **Average Relevance Score:** 2.20 / 5.0  
- **Analysis:** This is the weakest step in the workflow. The rewritten queries often simply repeat the original question or generate vague, redundant, or poorly formed sub-questions. There is a lack of meaningful decomposition of the user's intent, resulting in sub-questions that do not aid in precise document retrieval.
- **Common Error Patterns:**
  - Repetition of the original question as a sub-question.
  - Vague or generic sub-questions that do not clarify or break down the user's intent.
  - Poorly structured or awkwardly phrased sub-questions.
  - Missed opportunities to generate specific, targeted queries that would improve downstream retrieval.

### Step: retrieve_docs

- **Average Correctness Score:** 3.60 / 5.0  
- **Average Relevance Score:** 2.70 / 5.0  
- **Analysis:** The retrieval step reliably includes the most relevant document but also returns several irrelevant ones. This lack of precision reduces the efficiency of subsequent steps and can introduce noise into the answer synthesis process.
- **Common Error Patterns:**
  - Inclusion of unrelated documents (e.g., payroll, vacation policy) alongside the relevant one.
  - Failure to prioritize or filter for documents directly related to the user's question.
  - Occasional inclusion of tangentially related documents that do not directly address the query.

### Step: rerank_docs

- **Average Correctness Score:** 4.60 / 5.0  
- **Average Relevance Score:** 4.80 / 5.0  
- **Analysis:** Reranking generally succeeds in elevating the most relevant document, but sometimes includes less relevant documents or omits important context-providing documents (e.g., IT onboarding for software purchase questions).
- **Common Error Patterns:**
  - Inclusion of documents that are not directly relevant.
  - Exclusion of documents that provide necessary context for a complete answer.

### Step: synthesize_answer

- **Average Correctness Score:** 4.40 / 5.0  
- **Average Relevance Score:** 4.80 / 5.0  
- **Analysis:** The answer synthesis step produces accurate and relevant summaries, but can be limited by incomplete context from previous steps. Occasionally, it draws incorrect conclusions due to missing or misprioritized documents.
- **Common Error Patterns:**
  - Overly definitive statements when the evidence is incomplete.
  - Failure to acknowledge uncertainty or recommend further action when information is missing.

## Actionable Recommendations

- **Revamp the Query Rewriting Step:**
  - Implement more advanced logic or prompt engineering to ensure sub-questions are specific, distinct, and directly related to the user's intent.
  - Provide training examples that illustrate effective decomposition of complex queries.

- **Improve Document Retrieval Precision:**
  - Enhance filtering and ranking algorithms to prioritize only the most relevant documents and deprioritize or exclude unrelated ones.
  - Consider incorporating semantic similarity measures or feedback loops from downstream steps.

- **Refine Reranking Logic:**
  - Adjust reranking criteria to ensure all contextually important documents are included, especially those that provide necessary background or exceptions.

- **Enhance Answer Synthesis Robustness:**
  - Encourage the answer synthesis step to acknowledge when information is incomplete or ambiguous, and to suggest next steps (e.g., "Check with IT for software approval").
  - Train the model to avoid making definitive statements when the evidence is partial.

- **Monitor for Completeness in Final Answers:**
  - Add checks to ensure that all relevant details from the model answer are included, especially secondary or nuanced information.

- **Continuous Evaluation and Feedback:**
  - Regularly review low-scoring cases to identify new error patterns and update training data and prompts accordingly.
