# Chatbot Evaluation Deep-Dive Report

## Overall Summary

The chatbot demonstrates strong final answer quality, with consistently high scores in coherence, policy adherence, and safety, and only minor gaps in completeness compared to model answers. However, the internal workflow reveals a significant weakness in the document retrieval step, which frequently introduces irrelevant information and reduces the overall efficiency and precision of the chatbot's reasoning process.

## Key Findings

- **Positives:**
  - Final answers are highly coherent, relevant, policy-compliant, and safe, achieving perfect scores in these areas.
  - The query rewriting and answer synthesis steps in the workflow are both highly accurate and relevant, supporting strong final outputs.

- **Negatives:**
  - The document retrieval step consistently underperforms, with low relevance and moderate correctness scores, often retrieving multiple irrelevant documents.
  - Occasional final answers lack completeness due to missing details present in the model answer, typically stemming from incomplete information in the retrieved documents.
  - The retrieval step's imprecision is the primary bottleneck, impacting the overall workflow and, in some cases, the completeness of the final answer.

## Final Answer Analysis

### Criterion Breakdown

- **answer_quality_vs_model:**  
  - **Average Score:** 4.50 / 5.0  
  - **Analysis:** The chatbot's answers are generally accurate and align well with model answers. The main reason for lower scores is incomplete coverageâ€”answers sometimes omit secondary but relevant details (e.g., informal check-ins in addition to annual reviews). This suggests that while the core information is captured, nuances or additional context may be missed, likely due to limitations in the information surfaced during earlier workflow steps.

- **coherence_and_relevance:**  
  - **Average Score:** 5.00 / 5.0  
  - **Analysis:** All final answers are well-structured, logically organized, and directly address the user's question. No issues with clarity or relevance were observed.

- **policy_adherence:**  
  - **Average Score:** 5.00 / 5.0  
  - **Analysis:** The chatbot consistently adheres to organizational policies, with no instances of policy violations or inappropriate guidance.

- **safety:**  
  - **Average Score:** 5.00 / 5.0  
  - **Analysis:** All responses are safe, with no harmful, offensive, or risky content detected.

#### Common Themes in Low-Score Reasons

- Incomplete answers due to missing secondary details.
- Gaps in completeness are typically traceable to insufficient or imprecise information retrieved during the workflow.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step: retrieve_docs

- **Average Correctness Score:** 3.60 / 5.0  
- **Average Relevance Score:** 2.90 / 5.0  
- **Analysis:**  
  - The retrieval step frequently returns sets of documents where only one is directly relevant to the user's query, with the remainder being unrelated (e.g., retrieving payroll or IT onboarding documents for a vacation policy question).
  - This lack of precision dilutes the quality of information available for subsequent steps and is the most significant source of workflow inefficiency.
  - Failure reasons consistently cite the inclusion of irrelevant documents and insufficient filtering for topic-specific content.

### Step: rewrite_query

- **Average Correctness Score:** 4.50 / 5.0  
- **Average Relevance Score:** 5.00 / 5.0  
- **Analysis:**  
  - The query rewriting step is highly effective, accurately reformulating user questions to optimize downstream processing.
  - No significant issues were identified; this step supports strong performance in later stages.

### Step: synthesize_answer

- **Average Correctness Score:** 4.50 / 5.0  
- **Average Relevance Score:** 5.00 / 5.0  
- **Analysis:**  
  - The answer synthesis step reliably produces accurate and relevant responses, provided that the necessary information is available from previous steps.
  - Minor drops in correctness are linked to incomplete information from the retrieval step, not to flaws in synthesis logic itself.

#### Common Error Patterns

- The primary recurring error is the retrieval of irrelevant documents, which propagates through the workflow and occasionally results in incomplete final answers.
- No significant error patterns were observed in the query rewriting or answer synthesis steps.

## Actionable Recommendations

- **Improve Document Retrieval Precision:**
  - Enhance filtering and ranking algorithms to prioritize documents directly relevant to the user's query, using stricter topic matching and exclusion of unrelated content.
  - Consider implementing semantic search or topic modeling to better align retrieved documents with user intent.

- **Feedback Loop for Retrieval Quality:**
  - Integrate a feedback mechanism where downstream steps can flag insufficient or irrelevant retrievals, prompting a secondary retrieval attempt or escalation.

- **Augment Retrieval with Contextual Signals:**
  - Use metadata, document tags, or user query context to further refine retrieval results and reduce noise.

- **Monitor and Address Completeness Gaps:**
  - Analyze cases where final answers lack completeness and trace them back to retrieval failures, using these as targeted examples for retraining or rule refinement.

- **Maintain High Standards in Later Workflow Steps:**
  - Continue monitoring the query rewriting and answer synthesis steps to ensure they maintain their current high performance as retrieval improves.
