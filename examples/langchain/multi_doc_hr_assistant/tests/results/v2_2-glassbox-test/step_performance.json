It correctly outlines the procedures for booking travel (pre-approval, reimbursement, expense report submission, receipt requirements) and for requesting a day off (two weeks' advance notice, employee portal, manager approval). No critical information from the relevant documents is omitted or misrepresented."

Both sub-questions directly address the user's original intent."

        "reasoning": "The step correctly retrieves documents that are relevant to the two sub-questions: one about professional conduct (conduct.txt) and one about expense filing (expense_policy.txt). However, it also retrieves unrelated documents about performance reviews, payroll, and vacation policy, which are not relevant to the user's question. The correct documents are present, but the inclusion of unrelated ones slightly reduces the score."

Ideally, only documents directly related to professional conduct during business trips and expense filing should be retrieved. The presence of unrelated documents (performance reviews, payroll, vacation policy) dilutes the relevance of the retrieval step."
